**1. Token Amount**

The maximum token amount is 5,000,000 ATFs.
Tokens are minted during the crowdsale and the total supply is fixed at the end of the crowdsale so that the maximum token amount might not be reached. Soft Cap is 1.3 million dollars in ethereum. If Soft Cap is not implemented, the money will be returned to investors.
In case the maximum number should be reached, the crowdsale allows for up to 1,514 atoms to be created due to arithmetic imprecisions.
